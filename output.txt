Most Negative Comment:
this type of scam has become very common in brazil. the preferred victims of cyber thieves are elderly people who use banking apps on their smartphones. 
every now and then, the police bust a gang and arrest the criminals. but a few days later, the same type of crime happens again using the same virtual tools. 
brazilian law requires banks to protect the rights of the elderly. but in recent months, the courts have begun to consolidate the understanding that the blame for 
the losses lies not with the bank, which failed to adopt strict virtual security routines, but rather with the elderly who were victims. this is truly regrettable.
